[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dmecke/FamilyTree.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dmecke/FamilyTree)

Maintain your personal family tree. This project is based on the open source
framekwork Symfony2. It lets you add and edit family members and show them in
a tree hierarchy.

Your family tree is now ready to be filled with data!

When it comes to installing the Symfony Standard Edition, you have the
following options.


Intention
---------

The intention of this project is simply to have a nice way of maintaining
your personal family tree. There is no specific long-term-target this project
is aiming for, but I try to add some features from time to time and improve
the usability.
